**Key recommendations:**
*	Loyalty programs leveraging shopping behavior while traveling allow users to turn ride time into shopping rewards. 
* Promotional season for casual users is considered to be May – October, promoting special fee discounts focusing on docked/electric bikes. 
* Utilizing digital review sites like Yelp or ticketing sites to promote our campaign. Plus, partnership with these sites helps to control relationship management and send promotional events during the peak season. 


**Key insights:**

* Attraction sites have multiple sources of information for users to get information and buy tickets in advance online. 
* Service fees for electric bikes are charged by the time used and unlock fees for docked bikes
